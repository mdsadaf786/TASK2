#DESCRIPTION : 

CODTECH C LANGUAGE INTERNSHIP TASKS – PROJECT DESCRIPTION This repository contains the completed solution for all four internship tasks assigned by CODTECH as part of the C Programming Language internship. The internship primarily focused on practical implementation of core C programming concepts, including file handling, data structures, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques. Each task was carefully designed to enhance hands-on coding skills and provide real-world problem-solving experience in the C programming language.

Task 2: Singly Linked List – Insert, Delete & Traverse The second task is based on the implementation of a singly linked list, one of the fundamental data structures in computer science. The program demonstrates:

1.Insertion of new nodes at the beginning of the list 
2.Deletion of a node by value 
3.Traversal to print the elements of the list sequentially.

The code (task2.c) makes use of dynamic memory allocation through malloc() to create new nodes. It helps in understanding how memory is managed in heap space during runtime. Linked lists are widely used in operating systems, memory management, and database applications due to their flexibility and dynamic nature.
